	<h1>Mason Rocco, The Ohio State University</h1>
	<!-- Use <h1> to initiate a heading -->
	<p>This is my first ever HTML Page. I have no experience in HTML
		but it seems straightforward. My name is Mason Rocco, and I am a
		second year student at The Ohio State University. I am studying Data
		Analytics and am very excited to see what the rest of this course
		holds for me. The list below shows a few of the classes I am currently
		taking.</p>
	<!-- Use <p> to initiate a paragraph -->
	<ul>
		<!-- Use <ul> to initiate a unordered list -->
		<li>CSE 2221</li>
		<li>STAT 3201</li>
		<li>BIO 1101</li>
		<!-- Use <li> for each part of the list -->
	</ul>
	<!-- Use </ul> to end the list -->

	<p>The table below shows some of my favorite fruits and vegetables</p>
	<table border="2">
		<!-- Use <table> to create a table. Border = 2 creates a border with
		 line of thickness 2. -->
		<tbody>
			<!-- Use <tbody> to initiate the body of the table -->
			<tr>
				<!-- Use <tr> to initiate a row in the table -->
				<td><b> Fruits </b></td>
				<td><b> Vegetables </b></td>
				<!-- Use <td> to initiate items in the table. Used <b> to bold 
				the items -->
			</tr>
			<!-- Use </tr> to end the row of the table -->

			<tr>
				<td>Apple</td>
				<td>Carrot</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Banana</td>
				<td>Broccoli</td>
			</tr>
			<!--  Same process as above for this row of the table -->
		</tbody>
		<!-- Use </tbody> to end the body of the table -->
	</table>
	<!-- Use </table> to end the table -->

	<p>
		This is a picture of broccoli, my favorite vegetable. <br></br> <img
			src="broc.jpg" alt="broccoli" />
	</p>
	<!-- Use <p> to start the paragraph. <br> creates a break to make the image 
	organized neatly. <img> adds the image. -->

		This link will take you to YouTube, one of my favorite websites: <a
			href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>
	</p>
	<!-- Use <p> to start another paragraph. <a> creates a hyperlink. -->

<!-- In this project, I used https://www.tutorialspoint.com/xhtml/ which was 
very helpful in learning how to use XHTML. I have never used XHTML before and
 the website was great for beginners. -->
